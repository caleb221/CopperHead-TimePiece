# Software
     The ESP32 holds a SPIFFS filesystem containing the following files:
               --> index.html (should erase when BLE works) 
               --> userConf.json (known WiFi/Passwords) user edit on upload/web interface
               --> sysTime.json (last updated time) user edit on upload/web interface
               --> highScores.json (high score info for games *UNTESTED*)
     The ESP32 spends most of its time in deep sleep, unless woken from the UI buttons
     Upon wakeup the ESP32 will update the OLED with month, day of week, battery level, temperature, and humidity.
     The HPDL-1414 is used for time in HH:MM format. "1259" = 12:59
     There is also a timer on the watch so that it cannot be awake for too long (always default to sleep)

# Gerber / BOM
      check out the Manufacturing Files folder for these!
      --> Gerber_PCB_esp32SmartWatch_2.zip  2-Layer Board **DOES NOT HAVE MICROPHONE**
      --> Gerber_PCB_esp32SmartWatch_3.zip  4-Layer Board **MOST CURRENT**
      I got most normal components at LCSC (excluding those listed below)
      PCB made at JLCPCB
      --> I soldered on the components but I'm sure the SMT Assembly is an option given you match up the BOM

# TODO
     Get a stencil/ hot air blower so I can solder on the MPU-9250 <br>
     Make an addon with the modular breakouts (I2C/ UART)
               --> Raspberry pi 0 (with something cool)
               --> SD Card (SPI in Software, would need both ports)
               --> Geiger counter
               --> C02 Monitor
               --> Smart home / MQTT control (would need a UI sub directory added)
               --> Connect LoRa and control the smart farm! (this would take awhile)
# Would Be Nice:
     Waterproof case (hasunCast/PCB potting/ Resin)
     Glass over screens
     smaller PCB (if possible)
     bigger battery (needs to fit inside the case!)
     move buttons to bottom layer / change to right angled tactile buttons
     Use external RTC (DS3231 /C9866) OR (PCF8563M / C434478)
                      (part  / LCSC)
     Android Application (web UI takes place of this for now)
     Use BLE Server implementation (commented out at bottom of code) --> 
          accepts JSON data and updates internal filesystem
          Web Server uses same functions and tested, BLE with JSON is UNTESTED
