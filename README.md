# IN PROGRESS
    --> waiting on shipping and hardware testing

# Features
  Watch based around the ESP32 and HPDL1414. <br>
  Update time with NTP in known WiFi Areas (SSIDS/Passwords saved in SPIFFS JSON file) <br>
  32Khz Crystal for accuracy during deep sleep<br>
  Temperature and Humidity readings <br>
  Battery Charging and monitoring <br>
  I2C/UART modular breakout for future sensors/ICs <br>
  Chrome Dino Game  <br>
  Space Invaders Game <br>
   **footprint is there but currently no way to solder on MPU-9250** <br>
   Update WiFi networks and time over a hosted website incase there are no known networks around and time is off.

# Gerber / BOM
       check out the Manufacturing Files for these!
       I got most components at LCSC (excluding HPDL-1414)
       PCB made at JLCPCB

# TODO
     Get a stencil/ hot air blower so I can solder on the MPU-9250 <br>
     Make an addon with the modular breakouts (I2C/ UART)
               --> Raspberry pi 0 (with something cool idk, personal assistant?)
               --> SD Card (SPI in Software, would need both ports)
               --> Geiger counter
               --> C02 Monitor
               --> Smart home / MQTT control (would need a UI sub directory added)
               --> Connect LoRa and control the smart farm! (this would take awhile)
# Would Be Nice:
     Waterproof case
     Glass over screens
     smaller PCB (if possible)
     bigger battery
     move buttons to bottom layer / change to right angled tactile buttons
     Use external RTC (PCF8563M / C434478)
     Android Application (web UI takes place of this for now)
     Use BLE Server implementation (commented out at bottom of code) --> 
          accepts JSON data and updates internal filesystem
          Web Server uses same functions and tested, BLE with JSON is UNTESTED
